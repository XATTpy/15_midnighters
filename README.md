# Night Owls Detector

This script displays a list of devman.org users who sent tasks in the midnight.

# Quickstart

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

Then run the script:

```bash
$ python3 seek_dev_nighters.py 
These users were noticed in what they study Python at night:
